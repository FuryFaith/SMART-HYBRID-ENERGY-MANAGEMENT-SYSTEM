# **SMART HYBRID ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING FUZZY LOGIC**
## Final year project by Aravindhakshan Seshadri

### Abstract
_Energy consumption has increased exponentially since the start of the new millennia. The arrival of the smart grid era has led to renewable energies such as sun, wind, water, etc. being harnessed to help achieve energy supply and demand._

_This paper proposes a Smart Hybrid Energy Management System (SHEMS) which can be easily installed and is implemented using Fuzzy Logic based on various parameters such as time, load size, grid availability, battery status. SHEMS architecture consists of an integrated battery and load management system. The proposed architecture is expected to optimize energy consumption and save energy costs._

### Smart Hybrid Energy Management System
*The Smart Hybrid Energy Management System (SHEMS) is a critical home device for effective smart grid control at the demand side. This track and arranges different home appliances in real-time, using the human-machine interface to save power costs and maximize energy efficiency usage, based on consumer expectations in smart houses. With that concerns about global energy security and environmental pollution, increasingly dispersed renewable generations, such as wind turbines, solar panels, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), etc., will be incorporated into the grid with slowly increasing penetration into active distribution grids.*

_Each home has two energy-related parts: consumption and generation. The energy usage component involves various home appliances and lamps. The energy generation component comprises renewable energies such as solar and wind energy. Because a home consumes and generates energy, to minimize the energy cost, a control device like a home server needs to monitor and control both energy consumption and energy generation._
