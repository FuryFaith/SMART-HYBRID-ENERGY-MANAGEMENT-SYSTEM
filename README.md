## **SMART HYBRID ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING FUZZY LOGIC**
## Final year project by Aravindhakshan Seshadri

### Smart Hybrid Energy Management System
*The Smart Hybrid Energy Management System (SHEMS) is a critical home device for effective smart grid control at the demand side. This track and arranges different home appliances in real-time, using the human-machine interface to save power costs and maximize energy efficiency usage, based on consumer expectations in smart houses. With that concerns about global energy security and environmental pollution, increasingly dispersed renewable generations, such as wind turbines, solar panels, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), etc., will be incorporated into the grid with slowly increasing penetration into active distribution grids.*

_Each home has two energy-related parts: consumption and generation. The energy usage component involves various home appliances and lamps. The energy generation component comprises renewable energies such as solar and wind energy. Because a home consumes and generates energy, to minimize the energy cost, a control device like a home server needs to monitor and control both energy consumption and energy generation._

### Methodology
Fuzzy logic systems are based on logical reasoning along with the ability to fuzzify any system that makes it easier to execute. Fuzzy Logic Controllers are used in many industrial processes because of which control activity takes place like human and the control process was easy once built. To build the controller number of parameters need to be selected and then membership function and rules based on heuristic information are selected. The SHEM Framework has four input membership functions and one output membership function. Totally five membership functions are designed based on the parameters i.e Time, Load, Grid Availability, and Battery Status.

### Implementation
In Proteus Design Suite the real-time implantation is done using Schematic Capture. Proteus Programming Suite is a proprietary suite of software tools mainly used for automating electronic programming. The software is primarily used by electronic design engineers and technicians to build schematics and electronic prints for printed circuit board manufacture.
The Proteus Design Suite uses schematic capture, both for simulation design and as the design process of a PCB layout project. It is also a central feature and integrated into all product setups.
The Proteus microcontroller simulation works by either adding a hex file or debug file to the schematic portion of the microcontroller. Then, it is simulated with any related analog and digital electronics. This makes its use in fields such as engine control, temperature control, and user interface design in a wide range of project prototyping. It also finds use in the general community of hobbyists and is convenient to use as a training or teaching tool, since no hardware is required.
